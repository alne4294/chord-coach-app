  <h2><span>Welcome to Chord Coach!</span></h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>Chord Coach is a chord randomization application that musicians can use to practice chord voicings, scales, licks, vocabulary, improvisation and other musical techniques in the twelve keys evenly.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>

  <p><span>You can think of Chord Coach as a flash card generator for chord symbols.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Chord Coach can be used to not only practice randomly generated chords, but also common chord progressions such as major and minor 2-5&rsquo;s and 2-5-1&rsquo;s.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By allowing Chord Coach to randomize the chords for you, you can give your full attention to the technique(s) you are working on and relax because the Chord Coach will make sure that you are practicing in all twelve keys equally.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Practicing the traditional way by manually transposing into the different keys following the circle of fifths, minor thirds, or chromatic scale is still beneficial, but after a while the patterns become monotonous and the musician can lose focus.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Chord Coach&rsquo;s randomization of the chord systems keeps the practice interesting and keeps the musicians attention focused enhancing the efficiency of the practice session.</span>
  </p>
  <p>By increasing the tempo of Chord Coach, you add a little bit of pressure to your mental systems that help you find
    the technique your practicing, in the key that your currently in.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By trying to repeat these
    processes at a quicker and quicker tempo, you not only solidify the memorization of the technique but increase your
    ability to visualize your instrument mentally.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Being able to practice, and work through
    techniques mentally is a crucial skill needed to achieve the highest level of musicianship on your instrument of
    choice.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><span>Getting Started</span></h2>
  <p><span>Let&rsquo;s go through a basic example of how to use the Chord Coach to learn a simple chord voicing on the piano.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The targeted technique of this week's practice is to learn a root position major7 and minor7 chord in all twelve keys.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  </p>
  <p><span><strong>Step 1.</strong>&nbsp;Open up the chord options section.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make sure that Root Note is set to &lsquo;All Selected&rsquo;, this will ensure that the application will choose between all twelve keys when scrambling the chords.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(If you wanted to practice just a few keys, say, C, G and D, you could select those here).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then in the Chord Pattern section, select Single Chord.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Under Chord Quality, select the ma7 and mi7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then set the amount of chords you want to appear at one time using the slider.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Try starting with either eight or sixteen.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now open up the Metronome Options.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Set the metronome to 40 BPM using the slider, make sure Beats is set to quarter notes and set the Measures Between Chord Changes to four.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What this means is that the metronome will click at 40 beats per minute, each click will be a quarter note, and each chord or measure will repeat four times before moving onto the next measure and chord.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>With the Chord Coach set up with these settings we will now start practicing.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hit the <strong>Scramble</strong> button at the bottom of the page and Chord Coach will randomly generate your first set of chord changes to practice.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let&rsquo;s say that the first chord that pops up is an Amaj7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The system you have decided to use for finding the chord is to start out with a major triad in root position, find the octave and add in the note one half step below that octave, thus giving you a root position major7 chord.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once you find the first chord using your system press <strong>Play</strong>.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>You now have four measures at forty beats per minute to use your system to find the next chord so that you can play it EXACTLY on beat one of the measure that the chord changes on.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Practice in this manner with as slow a tempo as you need, and as many repeats as you need to be successful.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After a few practice sessions at this speed, you can make things more difficult by raising the tempo, or by lowering the Measures Between Chord Changes.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once you can play the root position major7 and minor7 chord at 160 beats per minute using only one measure between chord changes you have successfully learned the targeted technique.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You can move onto the next technique you want to learn.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remember that memorization takes time, and once you feel you have learned a voicing (in this case a maj7 and min7 voicing) you will still need to come back and review it a few times a week until the new voicing have been stored into your long term memory.</span>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2><span>Final Tips</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Practice extremely slow</strong> - what is the tempo you can play this at perfectly the first time?</p>
  <p><span>Remember, you are practicing a mental system for finding techniques.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The result of practicing the system is that you will have your targeted technique memorized in twelve keys.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>
  </p>
  <p>160 BPM is only a rough guideline to get things embedded into your memory - try to learn all of your techniques so
    that you can play them at 200 BPM and beyond without making any mistakes.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The faster you can
    perform your technique without mistakes, the better it is memorized and can be recalled and used in a split second!&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>
